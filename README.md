# My Student Portfolio Website  
by **Yatharth Upadhyay**

This is a simple multi-page portfolio website that I created using basic **HTML and CSS**.  
It’s a beginner-level project meant to practice page structure, layout, navigation, and forms.

 About the Project

The website has four pages:

- **Home** – a short welcome message  
- **About Me** – a small introduction and my photo  
- **Skills** – three skill/project cards arranged using Flexbox  
- **Contact** – a basic form where users can enter their details  

The main goal of this assignment was to show:

- Proper HTML structure  
- Basic CSS styling  
- Use of **float** (in the navigation bar)  
- Use of **flexbox** (in the skills section)  
- Creating and using a simple folder structure
